        <p>Ducks are the coolest animal out there. They fly, go on land, and swim! What a tri-fecta!! what else would you want in an animal!</p>

      <div class="output-geese">
        <p>Geese are basically just like ducks, except they're bigger and make more noise. Geese are probably one of the most annoying types of birds. If you've ever been to a park after a gaggle of geese was there, you know what I'm talking about. But don't trash talk them when they're around, because geese do not mess around. They will attack you!</p>

      <div class="output-panda">
        <p>Pandas are all about the Eucalyptus; it's their go to munchies! They look like they're wearing a mask all the time, but it's not because they're doing anything shady. The giant panda spends about two-thirds of its day feeding and the remainder resting. What. A. Life.</p>
